# Secure Password Generator

This Python script generates strong and secure passwords that adhere to specific criteria, ensuring high security for various applications. It uses the `secrets` and `string` modules to generate passwords that meet predefined length and character type requirements.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-password-generator.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. Navigate to the repository directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd secure-password-generator
   ```

4. Run the script to generate a strong password:
   
   ```bash
   python generate_password.py
   ```

   The script will prompt you to specify the desired password length and character types.

5. The generated strong password will be displayed according to the specified criteria.

## Functionality

- The script defines a `create_pw` function that generates a strong password.
- Password Length: Default is 12 characters, but it can be customized as needed.
- Character Types: At least one special character and at least two digits.

## Customization

- To modify the default password length, adjust the `pw_length` parameter in the `create_pw` function.
- The script can be easily extended to include additional character sets or adjust criteria for password strength.
